## Learning Objectives

- The students should be able to explain the concept of binary trees and distinguish them from other tree structures, such as binary search trees, highlighting their organizational and retrieval properties.
- The students should be able to perform basic operations on binary trees, including insertion, deletion, and search, demonstrating an understanding of how these operations maintain the tree's structure and integrity.
- The students should be able to describe various traversal methods used in binary trees, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal, and demonstrate proficiency in applying these methods to explore tree structures effectively.
- The students should be able to identify real-world applications of binary trees in hierarchical data representation, including corporate hierarchies, file systems, family relationships, and decision-making processes, and evaluate the efficiency of using binary trees in these contexts.


#### Binary Trees
Similar to linked lists, binary trees consist of TreeNode Object, with a maximum of 2 potential child tree nodes. One node that attaches at the "left" and another on the "right".

#### Binary Search Tree
A Binary Search Tree (BST) Is very similar to a binary tree. Each node in a BST holds a value, with the left child containing a smaller value and the right child containing a larger value. This arranges the nodes in a sorted manner allow for quick retreval using the binary search algorithm.


### Binary Tree Operations

- **Insertion**: Adding new nodes to the tree, while maintaining the trees properties

- **Deletion**: Removing nodes from the tree while keeping the tree intact

- **Search**: Finding a specific node within the tree

- **Traversal**: Parsing throught he entire tree
